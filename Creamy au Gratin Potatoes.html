    <h1 class="hleft">Creamy au Gratin Potatoes</h1>
    <p class="script">These au gratin potatoes are my husband's favorite â€” he considers it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>
    <h2 class="hleft">Ingresients</h2>
    <ul class="script">
        <li><b>Potatoes:</b> This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
        <li><b>Onion:</b> Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Butter and flour:</b> The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b> Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="hleft">Directions</h2>
    <ol class="script">
        <li><b>Assemble the casserole:</b> Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
        <li><b>Make the sauce:</b> Melt the butter in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the casserole:</b> Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
